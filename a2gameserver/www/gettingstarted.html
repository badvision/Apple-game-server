<h1>Connect the Apple to a PC or Mac</h1>


Connect your apple // (not a mac) to your PC/Mac with
an appropriate null-modem serial cable.&nbsp; See this wonderful <a href="http://home.swbell.net/rubywand/Csa2T1TCOM.html">apple telecom FAQ</a> for more details.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>It is highly recommended
you test your serial connection is working such that you can send and
receive data to and from the apple. &nbsp;For example, in Windows you
can do this using Hyperterminal. &nbsp;The Apple Telecom FAQ above also
has tips on how to go about testing this. &nbsp;Note the baud rate and
flow control settings you used, as these will be important to getting
the java program to talk to the Apple later on.
<p>And finally, if you have a SSC refer to the FAQ for recommended dip
switch settings if you are not too familiar with configuring the super
serial card.<i> </i></p>

<h1>Obtain Java</h1>


Install java and verify you can use it from the command line by
typing "java -version" which should report java 1.5 similar (this will NOT work with java 1.4 or earlier!)
<ul>


  <li>Java 1.5 for Windows, Linux and Solaris is available directly from Sun: <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp</a></li>


  <li>Java 1.5 for&nbsp; Mac OS X is available directly from Apple: <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/java2se50release1.html%20">http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/java2se50release1.html </a></li>

<div class="section">
<h1>Download the apple game server</h1>


Download the <a href="http://prdownload.berlios.de/a2gameserver/a2gameserver-binary-1.0.zip">latest binary release</a>. &nbsp;If you would like to see how the java or apple code
sections work, feel free to grab the <a href="http://prdownload.berlios.de/a2gameserver/a2gameserver-source-1.0.zip">source files</a> as well.
&nbsp;Decompress them all to the same base directory (the bundle
packages should go in the <span style="font-style: italic;">/lib/data</span> directory and the binary should be mostly contained in the <span style="font-style: italic;">/dist</span> directory.)<br>


The binary distribution contains a Win32 build of the <a href="http://www.rxtx.org/">RXTX library</a>. &nbsp;If you're using windows, go on to the next step.<br>


<br>


If you are using Linux, Mac OSX, or Solaris (really?) then you should
get the appropriate port of the rxtx native libraries for your platform
from <a href="http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/download.html">here</a>. &nbsp;Once you've obtained the compiled libraries, place them in the <span style="font-style: italic;">lib</span> directory (and you can chuck out the win32 libraries since you're not worshiping the evil empire today)

<a name="setup"></a>
<div class="section">
<h1>Set up the game server</h1>

In the <span style="font-style: italic;">lib/data</span> subdirectory there is a file called <span style="font-style: italic;">init.txt.</span>
&nbsp;This is a regular text file tht can be modified to suit your
setup as you see fit. &nbsp;The first character of each line signifies
a specific way in which that line should be interpreted. &nbsp;This
behavior is explained in greater detail in the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Technical Details</span> section. &nbsp;Lines 16-21 are of greater importance when you're getting acquainted:<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<pre>; Change this statement to the appropriate flow control<br>; (for //e,//gs use HARDWARE or (maybe) XON, for //C use NONE)</pre>

<pre>!flow HARDWARE</pre>

<pre>; Change this statement to the baud rate your machine defaults to</pre>

<pre>!goto try19200</pre>

</div>

The <span style="font-style: italic;">!flow</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span></span>command
instructs the java program what type of flow control to use when
communicating with the apple. &nbsp;When you tested your connection
previously (you did this, right? ;-) you should have been able to
determine what setting worked best for your computer. &nbsp;If not, you
can try one of the recommended settings (and if you have to guess you
have a 1 in 3 chance of getting it right anyway)<br>

<br>

The <span style="font-style: italic;">!baud</span> command sets the
java program's local baud rate. &nbsp;(The apple's baud rate must be
set by sending code to the apple to reconfigure itself, which is why
the apple's inital baud rate and flow control must be known upfront.)<br>

<br>

The <span style="font-style: italic;">driver.txt</span> file is explained in detail in the<span style="font-style: italic;"> technical details</span> page. &nbsp; You shouldn't have to worry about it.

<a name="run"></a>
<div class="section">
<h1>Run the game server program</h1>


Boot the apple computer and press ctrl+reset to get to the basic prompt
(you should see a ] and a blinking checkerboard cursor).&nbsp; Type (<i>or mutter as an incantation if you listen to RetroBits</i>)
IN#2 and press return.&nbsp; The cursor will reappear, just leave it
alone. &nbsp;If you are using an apple computer with a super serial
card, type CTRL-A 2S so that the super serial card will echo typed
characters back to the host computer.<br>


<br>


On the pc/mac, enter a command shell (For example: start -&gt; run
-&gt; cmd.exe (enter)) and go into the project directory and type:
<p><b>java -Djava.library.path=lib -cp lib;lib/RXTXcomm.jar;dist/DiskServer.jar Diskserver <i>COM2</i></b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>


<p>(where
COM2 means you have already connected the apple to your pc's COM2 port
-- you can change this to any com port or what best suits your
environment.)</p>


<p><b>For Linux / Mac:</b> </p>


<p>Assuming the user has permissions to access the serial port (in this
case, <i>ttyS0</i> being the equivalent of <i>COM1 </i>under Windows), running thiscommand in the project's directory starts it up fine.</p>


<p><b>java -Djava.library.path=lib -cp<br>


lib:lib/RXTXcomm.jar:dist /DiskServer.jar Diskserver <i>/dev/ttyS0</i></b><br>


</p>


<p>(Thanks to TJ Nardi for letting me know how to run it on Linux!&nbsp; Go Java!)&nbsp;</p>


<p>If all goes well, you should see a menu of games appear on the apple
within a minute or so. &nbsp;If the startup process is not successful,
you should see some sort of error from the java program. &nbsp;Refer to
the FAQ for help on common error messages.</p>
