The page is being updated to reflect the new changes in 2.0 -- and since this was a significant rewrite, I more or less have to rewrite all my site's content and FAQ pages to reflect the new features and fix a few misconceptions in the old text.  In the meantime, you can get a quick rundown of how to start the program from the readme.txt in the current release.
